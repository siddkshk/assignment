This is Data set to Classify the Benign and Malignant cells in the given data set using the description about the cells in the form of columnar attributes.
This data was donated by researchers of the University of Wisconsin and includes the measurements from digitized images of fine-needle aspirate of a breast mass.

The breast cancer data includes 569 examples of cancer biopsies, each with 32 features.
One feature is an identification number, another is the cancer diagnosis and 30 are numeric-valued laboratory measurements. 
The diagnosis is coded as "M" to indicate malignant or "B" to indicate benign.

Missing attribute values: none
Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
